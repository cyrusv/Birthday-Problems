Hi Lily!

Sorry for your very late birthday gift. It is modest, but I think you'll
enjoy it. You can discover where it is by solving a series of puzzles.

Puzzle 1:
If I simultaneously roll 50 die, what is the probability that the sum
of all the faces will be either a multiple of 3, or a number whose
last digit is 7? Round to the nearest percent.

Puzzle 2:
Do Men or Women take longer Hubway rides in Boston? By how many seconds? 
Round the answer DOWN to the nearest integer.
Use the Hubway data from 2001-2013 at http://hubwaydatachallenge.org/

Puzzle 3:
Let's use your answers from 1 and 2. Add them together, and round to the nearest 10.
This number was used to encrypt the word 'lvygtylc' using a Caesarean Cipher.


Final Puzzle:
You caught Cyrus collaborating with Victor, trying to decide where to 
hide your gift
Unfortunately, his messages are encrypted!

You have a sneaking suspicion he's encrypting messages with DES in ECB mode,
and the key is the solution from Puzzle 3.

Good luck!
